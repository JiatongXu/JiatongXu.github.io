# Datascience Book that interests me

<Introduction to social network methods> by Robert A. Hanneman and Mark Riddle
Riverside, CA:Â  University of California, Riverside ( published in digital form at http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/ )
	

I was very interested in this book because I saw the beauty of combining linguistic research with data science in another computational corpus linguistics class. The involvement of data science allows us to analyze human language and regional cultural change from a quantitative perspective supported by big data.
